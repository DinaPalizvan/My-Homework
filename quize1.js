//? 1. What is the difference between setTimeout and setInterval ?
let Answer="ðŸ‘€We use setTimeout when we want our function to start after an amount of delay. we give it a function and a time in millieseconds and then our function runs *one time* after that amount of seconds.ðŸ‘€ But we use setInterval when we want our function to repeat *multiple times* after the time we give to it. In other words, setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time. setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval."
