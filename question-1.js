  todo1: what is the difference between an asynchronous function and a synchronous function?
*/

// ! Answer

/*
Synchronous Function:
- A synchronous function executes in a sequential manner, meaning that it blocks the execution of the program until it completes its task.
- When a synchronous function is called, the program waits for the function to finish before moving on to the next line of code.
Asynchronous Function:
- An asynchronous function allows the program to continue executing while it performs its task in the background.
- When an asynchronous function is called, the program does not wait for it to finish and can continue executing other tasks.
- Asynchronous functions are commonly used for tasks that may take a long time to complete, such as network requests.

In summary, the key difference between asynchronous and synchronous functions is how they manage the flow of execution in a program, with synchronous functions blocking the program's execution until they complete and asynchronous functions allowing the program to continue executing while they perform their tasks.
